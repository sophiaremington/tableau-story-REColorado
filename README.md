# REcolorado Tableau Story: Agent Performance and Market Trends

This project analyzes residential real estate transaction data from REcolorado, the largest MLS in Colorado. The interactive Tableau story explores agent performance, market participation, and pricing trends, with a focus on REALTOR® vs Non-REALTOR® listing activity from 2019 to 2025.

## Project Overview

Using Tableau, I developed a visual analytics dashboard to answer key business questions:

- How has REALTOR® participation changed over time?
- What production tiers are REALTORS® dominating?
- Has the recent NAR settlement impacted agent behavior or market activity?
- How are average prices and sales volumes trending across the region?

The insights help stakeholders evaluate the strategic role of REALTORS® in the Colorado housing market and understand post-settlement shifts in agent engagement.
